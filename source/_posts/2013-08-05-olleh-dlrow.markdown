###Static!

Initially it looks complicated because it must go through several steps and some of them are something new for me. But because it was Eid holiday and I was not doing anything, I decided to explore [Octopress](http://octopress.org)! Static web(blog) generator based on Jekyll.

Ohh yeah, finally I can use [Museo Slab](https://typekit.com/fonts/museo-slab) font, font that I want to put on a minimalist web interface.

hmmm ... learn something new is always fun!

P.S.: Welcome to the new domain, .net! Hopefully you, the reader likes to "the stars" that exist in this web. :D
