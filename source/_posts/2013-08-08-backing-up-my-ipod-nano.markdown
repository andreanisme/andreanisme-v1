At the Eid holiday this time I have enough time to finish some work that I have not been completed because of busy work.

In addition to completing *andreanisme.net* with Octopress as I described in [my previous post](http://andreanisme.net/log/olleh-dlrow/). I intend to revive the 5th Generation iPod Nano that I get from the [affiliate links in 2009](http://blog.andreanisme.com/archives/461). Wait a minute, why be revived? I did not bring my iPod when I decided to Jakarta to work (about 6 months ago). And after in Jakarta, I miss with my iPod and I thought to bring it to Jakarta after I returned home on the Eid holiday.

Holidays have arrived, and I found my iPod is still in the same place — at the computer desk drawer. But my iPod will not turn on. Naturally, the battery runs out because the iPod was never filled in a fairly long period of time. I plugged the iPod connector into my Macbook Pro to do the charging. After 1 minute, the Apple logo appeared on my iPod and iTunes detects the device it supports.

###Having backups of my favorite song is a must!###

After half an hour, I saw the songs what is in my iPod. I met a few playlists of my favorite musicians, including: Mr. Big, Scorpions, Queen, Guns n Roses, Gugun Blues Shelter, Dewa 19, and many more.

But I intend to replaces the existing songs on my iPod playlist with some newer. While not all the songs will be replaced, limited storage capacity of 8 GB iPod requires me to sort the songs.

Some songs on my iPod are the songs that I transfers from my old PC. Worse! My PC can no longer be turned on due to damaged hard drive. So it is very important for me to get a backup from my collection of favorite songs.

I am looking for a way to backup iPod to the Macbook Pro. Of course through the Google search. There are several ways and tools that can be used for backup. I tried several apps, there are a total of 3 applications for Mac that I am trying. But eventually the applications I use is [Imacsoft iPod to PC Transfer](http://www.imacsoft.com/ipod-to-pc-transfer.html). There are free and paid version ($ 24 for a license price). I decided to use the free version only, with limited backing 99 list of songs in one process (batch processing). With limited free version of this application, I actually enjoy the process of sorting while looking back at my music collection on the iPod and determine which will be maintained in an iPod or not!

Finally, I get the backup of my songs on my iPod, and they can be played in iTunes on my Macbook Pro. Of all the songs, I mark the "Bossanova Jawa" album as my favorite one. Since I was born and grew up in Solo — my hometown — which has thick Javanese tradition. :)
